Hey there! <img width="480" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00be1b19-a926-4449-9e0f-04e51d8f369f" />

I’m Arif, a Software Engineer based in Budapest.

I design and build backend systems, cloud-native applications, and full-stack projects with a focus on clean architecture and scalability.

If an idea or problem comes up, chances are I’ll try to break it down and build a working solution.

My main tech stack includes Java, Python, Go, and C++, with experience using Spring Boot, Flask, Django, .NET, and React. I regularly work with Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and CI/CD pipelines.

I’m currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at Ericsson, contributing to a Kubernetes-based orchestration platform and gaining hands-on experience with cloud-native systems and DevOps practices.

I’ve built and shipped a variety of projects ranging from enterprise-style backend platforms to distributed and cloud-focused systems — feel free to check out the pinned ones below.

Interests: gym, reading, drawing, and math.
